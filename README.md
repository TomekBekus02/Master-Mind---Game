**Description:**
A game built with React, where the goal is to decode a four-color code within 10 rounds. At the end of each round, the player receives hints indicating how close they are to the correct answer.
To start the game, click "Start Game", then select one of the four slots in the first row of the board. When the "Pool Colors" box appears, choose one of the six available colors. The selected color will then appear in the highlighted slot on the board.
